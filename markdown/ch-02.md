# Git Basics #

If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.

## Getting a Git Repository ##

You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.

### Staging Modified Files ###

Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called `benchmarks.rb` and then run your `status` command again, you get something that looks like this:

	$ git status
	# On branch master
	# Changes to be committed:
	#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
	#
	#	new file:   README
	#
	# Changed but not updated:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	#
	#	modified:   benchmarks.rb
	#

## Recording Changes to the Repository ##

You have a bona fide Git repository and a checkout or working copy of the files for that project. You need to make some changes and commit snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.


As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. You *stage* these modified files and then commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats. This lifecycle is illustrated in Figure 2-1.

### Staging Modified Files ###

Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called `benchmarks.rb` and then run your `status` command again, you get something that looks like this:

	$ git status
	# On branch master
	# Changes to be committed:
	#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
	#
	#	new file:   README
	#
	# Changed but not updated:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	#
	#	modified:   benchmarks.rb
	#

The `benchmarks.rb` file appears under a section named “Changed but not updated” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the `git add` command (it’s a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved). Let’s run `git add` now to stage the `benchmarks.rb` file, and then run `git status` again:

The editor displays the following text (this example is a Vim screen):

	# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
	# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
	# On branch master
	# Changes to be committed:
	#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
	#
	#       new file:   README
	#       modified:   benchmarks.rb
	~
	~

### Skipping the Staging Area ###

Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow. If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Providing the `-a` option to the `git commit` command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the `git add` part:

	$ git status
	# On branch master
	#
	# Changed but not updated:
	#
	#	modified:   benchmarks.rb
	#
	$ git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'
	[master 83e38c7] added new benchmarks
	 1 files changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Notice how you don’t have to run `git add` on the `benchmarks.rb` file in this case before you commit.
